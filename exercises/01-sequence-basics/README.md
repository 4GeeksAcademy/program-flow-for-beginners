# `01` Sequence Basics

Scenario: You prepare coffee before class. Define a linear flow: start, boil water, brew coffee, serve, end. No decisions.

## :memo: Instructions
1. Open `app.js` in this exercise folder.
2. Write or paste your Mermaid flow inside the template string.
3. Keep node ids (`A`, `B`, `C`, ...) and edges aligned with the rubric requirements.
4. Do not rename `answer` or `module.exports` in `app.js`.

## :bulb: Hint
- Your graph should include these key concepts: start, end.
- Aim for at least 3 edges in total before running tests.
- This exercise does not require branch condition labels.
- Avoid forbidden patterns in the diagram text: while, for.
