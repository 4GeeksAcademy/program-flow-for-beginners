# Welcome: How This LearnPack Works

In this project, each exercise asks you to solve a logic scenario by submitting a Mermaid flowchart.

## Where you write your solution

Edit only `app.js` inside each exercise folder.

## Workflow

1. Use any external Mermaid tool you prefer (for example, Mermaid Live Editor or draw.io).
2. Generate the diagram there.
3. Copy and paste the Mermaid code into `app.js`.

## :bulb: Hint
- You do not need to master Mermaid syntax in this tutorial.
- Focus on the logic requested by each exercise.
- If tests fail, compare your result with `rubric.json`.
