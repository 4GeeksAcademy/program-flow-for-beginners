# `02` If Else Basics

Scenario: You are at a party. A person can drink alcohol only if they are 18 or older. Build the decision flow for age check, allowed path, denied path, and end.

## :memo: Instructions
1. Open `app.js` in this exercise folder.
2. Write or paste your Mermaid flow inside the template string.
3. Keep node ids (`A`, `B`, `C`, ...) and edges aligned with the rubric requirements.
4. Do not rename `answer` or `module.exports` in `app.js`.

## :bulb: Hint
- Your graph should include these key concepts: start, input, valid, invalid, end.
- Aim for at least 3 edges in total before running tests.
- Use branch labels exactly as expected: yes, no.
- Keep names and labels simple to match the validator.
