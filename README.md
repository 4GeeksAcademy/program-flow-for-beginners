Interactive, auto-graded flowchart exercises to practice beginner programming logic with Mermaid.

## One-click setup (recommended)

Open in [Codespaces](https://codespaces.new/) and run:

```bash
learnpack start
```

## Local setup

1. Install LearnPack:
```bash
npm i @learnpack/learnpack -g
```
2. From the folder where `learn.json` exists, run:
```bash
learnpack start
```

## Exercise structure

Each exercise folder includes:

1. `app.js`: Editable Mermaid answer file (main working file).
2. `README.md`: Instructions in English.
3. `README.es.md`: Instrucciones en espanol.
4. `rubric.json`: Validation rules used by tests.
5. `test.js`: Exercise test entry.

`00-welcome` is readme-only and has no coding test files.

## Notes

- Use the LearnPack VSCode extension for best auto-open behavior.
- Tests are strict by design; use failures as guidance, not as blockers.
